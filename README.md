## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   **Node.js** (v16 or later recommended)
*   **npm** (Node Package Manager)
*   **MongoDB** (Make sure your MongoDB server is running locally or provide a connection string for a cloud instance like MongoDB Atlas).

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Karanam-manasa/careerconnect.git
    cd careerconnect
    ```

2.  **Install Server Dependencies:**
    Navigate to the root directory and install the required npm packages.
    ```bash
    npm install
    npm install multer
    ```

3.  **Configure Environment:**
    *   The database connection string is currently set to `mongodb://localhost:27017/careerconnect` in `server.js`. If your MongoDB instance is running elsewhere, update this string.
    *   The email service is configured to use a Gmail account via `nodemailer`. You may need to generate an "App Password" for your Gmail account if you have 2-Factor Authentication enabled. Update the credentials in the `transporter` object in `server.js`.

4.  **Start the Server:**
    Run the following command to start the Express server. By default, it runs on `http://localhost:5000`.
    ```bash
    node server.js
    ```
    You should see `‚úÖ Connected to MongoDB` and `üöÄ Server running on http://localhost:5000` in your console.

5.  **Open the Application:**
    Open the `index.html` file in your web browser. You can do this by simply double-clicking the file or by using a live server extension in your code editor (like VS Code's "Live Server"). The application will then connect to your running backend.

### Default Admin Credentials

*   **Email:** `careerconnect868@gmail.com`
*   **Password:** `Admin@123`
